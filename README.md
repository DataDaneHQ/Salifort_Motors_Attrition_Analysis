## **Welcome!**

This repository showcases my completed project on Employee Attrition Analysis, developed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The project employs a structured, data-driven approach to identifying key drivers of employee turnover and providing actionable HR strategies to improve retention.

The project spans the entire analytics lifecycle, including:

- **Defining Objectives:** Identifying business challenges, aligning stakeholder needs, and setting clear goals.
- **Planning:** Structuring workflows, selecting methodologies, and defining key performance indicators.
- **Development:** Building Jupyter Notebooks to clean data, engineer features, and develop predictive models.
- **Visualization:** Full Exploratory Data Analysis visualizing insights and trends.
- **Delivery:** Crafting an executive report summarizing key findings, model performance, and actionable HR recommendations.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model for employee attrition, helping Salifort Motors understand and mitigate workforce turnover. By leveraging machine learning, the analysis identifies tenure-based attrition risks, workload burnout factors, and career stagnation triggers.

This repository highlights real-world HR applications of data analytics, demonstrating expertise in feature engineering, model evaluation, and strategic decision-making. The insights gained empower HR teams with data-driven retention strategies, reducing hiring costs and improving workforce stability.
